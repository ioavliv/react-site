description: I care deeply for nature. Oh, you're gonna be in a coma, all right. He'll want to use your yacht, and I don't want this thing smelling like fish. Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you.

## Test

This is an example blog post with React components. This page is using the `Image` component from Next.js.

```jsx:example-post.mdx
<Image
  alt={`Bridge`}
  src={`/images/bridge.jpg`}
  width={1440}
  height={960}
  priority
/>
```

### Code Blocks

This starter also comes with fancy code blocks with code titles.

```jsx:example.jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Writing

As I learned from my high school [English literature teacher](/posts/teacher), the word "essay" comes from the French meaning “to attempt”. I decided to write a series of essays to live on my website to serve as my personal statements and opinions on topics that are dear to me. They interest me/call to me. I am drawn to them. All my thoughts on a subject. I just want to write about the things I care about and attribute where I got inspiration from and who I learned from and what books I read. If you already know about these, you are unlikely to learn anything new from me. I just want to share my influences and what shapes my worldview. 

These essays are *attempts* to straighten out my thoughts on particular subjects that interest me and on another level, these essays are *attempts* to improve my writing ability and quality to produce something worth reading.
