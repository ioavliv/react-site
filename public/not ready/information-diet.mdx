It may come as a surprise to people that I write about my personal life so openly in so much detail on this site given that I have shared so little of my life on any social media platform for the past 20 years of my life (granted, social media hasn't been around that long). After reading Cal Newport's book digital minimalism, I've realized that if I really stop to think what value I get from social media, I discover that there are better alternatives. What is it that I want to share anyway? It isn't any photos but what I want to share is creative work. Hopefully, I can find people who care as much as I do about the things I write about.

I may be a luddite or a heretic of these times, but I dont have facebook, instagram, twitter or any other social media account except youtube (if that counts). There is an enormous value in slowing down. So much useless information similar to junk food. Treat your attention with respect. It takes some time getting used to a different pace of intake but I find that it provides me with more clarity and calm mind

We are swept away by the technology of our time without taking the time to reflect on what it is doing to us, how it is changing us, and how we truly feel about it. Studies have shown that phone addiction causes anxiety and depression.

The average screen time has gone up so much that people are beginning to wonder why they are spending their time in this way. If you believe you are wasting your own time online and could be doing something more useful with your time, why are you compelled to keep using these platforms that hurt your mental health?

I did not write this blogpost to tell you that you are addicted or that you feel this way. I'm simply suggesting to check in with yourself. The next time you find yourself mindlessly scrolling on your favorite platform, ask yourself how you feel. 

## Why use social media

What are you getting out of this? Why do I use instagram? Is this the best way to receive these benefits? Do I like the way I feel when I use instagram? It is important to find out what your underlying motive for using a platform is. For me, I believed I used instagram to see how distant friends are doing when in fact I was just using it to relieve boredom. You might use it to get affirmation by the number of likes your posts get. I use YouTube to forget about and procrastinate from difficult projects. The reason why it is important to uncover these underlying motives is that they can then be addressed individually. Is this really the best way to satisfy this motive? If not, why not replace this behavior with a better one that will accomplish the same task. If I want to relieve boredom, rather than directly opening YouTube I could pick up an interesting book instead. Of course, this is easier said than done, but discovering your underlying motive is the first step in changing your behavior.

**I want to clarify that I don’t think everyone needs to leave social media. I don’t even think I will stay away from these platforms indefinitely. What I am saying is that you should reflect upon these questions and ask yourself why you use them.**

We all face societal pressure to continue using these platforms for both engaging with others and posting about ourselves. I don't mean to invalidate this emotion. On the contrary, I believe it is a very strong need we have and even our biology and evolution wants us to conform with the tribe, but how can we be sure that conforming with society is actually healthy for us? How can we be sure that society itself is healthy, that we actually live in a healthy society?

## Designed to addict

When you watch videos on youtube or browse instagram, you are not thinking. You are letting the algorithm decide what you should think. As you watch something appear, you are consumed by that image/text/video. You are not searching for the next bit of content or information, you are merely swept along directionless. If you want to cultivate your thinking, you have to spend time away from these things because that is the only way you can give your mind the space to wander into new thoughts. It is okay to shut off your brain once in a while to be absorbed in an activity. Watching a good movie, learning from some documentary, etc. These are good ways to spend your time but only as long as you are doing these with intention. Don't open youtube on impulse when you're bored as if to say "show me something, entertain me". If you want to use youtube, think of who it is you want to see or what content you are looking for. Turn off recommendations.

It sells your data and forces you to focus your attention on it. It is designed to be addictive. You are being surveilled. Quitting social media is economic activism.  It is taking a stand against big tech and for your own independence and mental well-being.

## Information Overload

Give yourself space to think

Too much information is a problem of the modern world. Never before in human history have we had so much access to information. The internet is only a few decades old, and no amount of time will allow any one person to absorb all the knowledge that is on it. The internet is, after all (for all intents and purposes), the collection of all of current human knowledge.

In the past, all information was valuable. Hearing gossip or news by word of mouth was valuable, and we could pay attention to all of it and absorb that information. Now, we are drowning in information and the validity of any information can be questioned as anyone can say anything with no need to prove or validate their ideas. Fake news spreads faster than the truth online, and we believe false claims even after we are told that they are false. We have not found a way around our biology that makes us susceptible to being tricked. We are essentially gullible.

**You spend your life constantly distracted**. Your attention is easily pulled by others. You have to stop being unconscious. Be conscious. Wake up. Notice when you are being manipulated into having an emotional reaction.

## What can you do about it

**What is the solution? I believe it is to limit your intake of information. Turn off the constant flow of information.** This may be hard to do. You might not realize the extent to which you have become addicted to novelty on the internet. You are likely addicted to the news, your friends' posts or likes on your own posts, or just endless entertainment.

It is a path less travelled, to walk against the current of society, but you may find this to be more meaningful, fulfilling, and you may lead a happier life because of it. Counterintuitively, taking in less information may make you more informed than others. When you reduce your intake of information, you will discover and remain closer to the things which you find are most important.

Life without social media is a lot fuller. You need to contact real people and see them in person. Build your community. You are a social creature, and phones are not a replacement for real human contact and interaction. Use the time that you would normally spend listening to the opinions of others and comparing yourself to others. Use that time to instead listen to your own thoughts and form your own opinions. Direct your own attention rather than letting it be directed for you.

## Why quit

I personally chose to delete my accounts for two main reasons: for my own mental health and productivity, and for society at large. As I mentioned previously, social media has harmful effects in that it makes you compare yourself to others, it keeps you perpetually distracted and manipulates your emotions subtly for the sole purpose of spending more time online and not for your own well-being. As for society, politics is one aspect that is particularly affected by social media. News and misinformation are rampant online and more extreme opinions are heard most loudly.

I believe technology can be used for good. I hope to one day be able to use my skills in computer science to build an ethical social media platform that does not run on the same business model of third-party advertising where time spent on the platform is the economic incentive. Until then, I will do my best to stay away and explain to others my reasons for doing so.

The world is moving too fast now. I am glad that I was born in this century and have access to great healthcare and information on demand but this time comes with its negatives. It is hard to slow down and read a book. Even watching a 2 hour long movie is hard for those who have become addicted to spending 5 hours watching 10-second clips. I grieve the slow pace of life there once was. Again, I know things now are amazing, but our minds are poorly equipped to handle the pace of the internet. I want more unevetful days where I read a bit, write, workout and do some coding work. Progress gets made in my corner of the world but I dont need to know about anyone else anywhere else. Pop culture and news and friends on social media and influencers and infotainment isn't necessary. Its hard to unplug and it feels like giving this up is turning your back on society but it feels good to be silent and hear nothing. Turn off the screens and don't post for a day and feel the joy of just existing. It sounds apocalyptic. I promise it is far from it.

Everyone needs a vice. IM addicted To YouTube. It could be YouTube or sugar or alcohol or drugs. Feeling like you need something else to be whole instead of finding peace right now. Contentment now. This moment is enough. I am enough. Stop running away from things or endlessly chasing them. My best friend said self improvement is a lie and no one can be a saint free from vice Or rather no one should want that boring life
