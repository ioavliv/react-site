Self-help gets a bad rap. I get it. It’s cringe, and sometimes even toxic, reinforcing many people’s feeling of inferiority and shame for not living up to their “full potential”, whatever that means. But I want to argue that self-help is selfless, or at least it can be if pursued with the right intentions.

The Stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius wrote, “What injures the hive injures the bee”. What he meant by this is that our individual well-being is dependent on that of our community. If we do something to harm those around us, we are only shooting ourselves in the foot. I think self-help flips this around by advocating that what is good for me (the individual) is good for others (society).

Let me give an example of this— I personally enjoy feeling peaceful. However, when I achieve this state of mind, I not only benefit from this feeling myself, but also from spreading it to others. Peace of mind is contagious. Just as when someone’s panic can cause hysteria in those around them, a calm demeanor can be a positive force in the world. I aspire to be that super-spreader of calm.

**Making yourself happy is not selfish if you are doing it to be better for others.** Meditating (or taking time for yourself in any way you prefer) to ground yourself in a disorienting world is something you do for the people you come in contact with throughout the day. You can leverage that relaxation time to act in accordance with your values more easily. Being a good person is hard to do when you're tired, unmotivated, and apathetic. Help yourself first, and then you will be in the best condition to help others.

It has been said that we are here on this planet for the sake of others, but the best thing we can do for them is to take care of ourselves so that they don't have to. The French essayist Montaigne had the following to say about friendship:

> In true friendship, in which I am expert, I give myself to my friend more than I draw him to me. I not only like doing him good better than having him do me good, but also would rather have him do good to himself than to me; he does me most good when he does himself good. - Montaigne
