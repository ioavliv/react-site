Who you choose to admire reveals a lot about yourself. It doesn’t matter whether they’re the people you interact with directly like friends and family, historical figures, celebrities, or fictional characters. What matters is that you can identify particular qualities, virtues, and characteristics to hold up as the gold standard to compare yourself to. Those qualities you admire in others reveal the person you want to become. There is an argument to be made against the idea of striving to change yourself, but self-improvement is a noble goal when you are doing it to help others.

We need people to look up to for guidance and inspiration. Heroes are necessary because they lead the way in our lives. You may have noticed that all artists begin by copying their favorite icons before they discover their own voices. It’s hard to make the argument that any artist has ever been completely original. The Beatles, for example, played rock like Elvis at first before developing their style. Picasso famously said, “art is theft”. All “unique” voices are found and stitched together from outside influences rather than constructed in isolation. Whether you are aware of it or not, you follow the example of the people you are effortlessly interested in.

If the things which we admire are what we imitate, we need to be careful about what qualities we select. Rather than try to imitate people’s external qualities (their clothes, cars, homes, personalities, mannerisms), it is wiser to imitate their internal characteristics (contentment, courage, discipline, humor, creativity) because those were the foundations that led them to possess whatever is externally visible.

These virtues are impressive because they are truly difficult to attain. It’s easy to be angry, jealous, lazy, ignorant, or impatient. These are all our natural tendencies. It takes work to overcome these basic predispositions. To do the opposite of what anyone else would do in the same situation is admirable because it takes so much effort to uncondition the mind. To have such mastery over oneself borders on the godlike.

Take as an example the life and death of Socrates, the first philosopher. He boldly questioned everyone and everything which led to his being sentenced to death for “corrupting the youth of Athens”. He was unapologetically himself, authentic, and didn’t care what others thought of him. On his last day, his student Plato recounted that he “appeared both happy in manner and words as he died nobly and without fear.” He drank the cup of brewed hemlock his executioner handed him, walked around until his legs grew numb and then lay down, surrounded by his friends, and waited for the poison to reach his heart.*****

Overcoming the fear of death and attachment to life is admirable because it reveals the possibility of transcending one’s self-importance. This does not romanticize suicidality, but rather stresses the importance of living (and if necessary dying) according to one’s well-examined beliefs. I admire those who are willing to sacrifice themselves for the sake of others, or in commitment to a just cause. Socrates did precisely that by balancing a strong attachment to his values with a light attachment to himself. These are the kinds of heroes to look up to.

The people we idolize are those who gracefully overcome hardship. These are the same people that use adversity as the fire to fuel them rather than extinguish their souls. They teach us that the way we behave when things are difficult is what truly counts. We only discover our worth when things get tough. Of course, we would prefer to avoid struggle, but we want to be strong when we inevitably have to face it.
