René Magritte is one of my favorite artists. Of the surrealist painters, he is the most philosophical but unlike other philosophers, he expressed his ideas through images instead of words. Of course, <i>The Treachery of Images</i> seen above is an exception. Here, Magritte directly uses language to communicate an idea with the viewer. Naturally people will see the label "This is not a pipe" and think it is a funny mistake but of course Magritte intentionally draws your attention to this quirk to make you consider its meaning. 

If asked, we would normally answer that the object in the painting is a pipe but this is a mistake in our language. Of course the painting of a pipe isn’t a real pipe, but we hardly feel the need to point out the difference. Likewise, even the word "pipe" is not a pipe. The word, just like the image, is merely a concept or representation and not the real thing. This painting invites us viewers to question the gap between symbols and their meanings. As the name of the painting suggests, the treachery of images is in their ability to deceive and confuse us.

When we give something a label, that is to say we name something, we trick our brains into thinking we fully know and understand it. We transform something complex and real into a neat, abstract concept that can be manipulated in our minds. The truth is that nothing can truly be captured by a representational symbol. This painting is a reminder that things are what they are, not what we say or think they are. The same concept also applies to our own self-image. I can call myself by my name, Ioav, or by descriptions such as white, male, Israeli, writer, programmer, friend, son, etc. All these labels try to capture the idea of who I am, but Magritte would argue that we can never know ourselves, especially through descriptions.

To me, Magritte’s painting <i>Son of Man</i> brings to mind questions about identity. I wonder “who is the man behind the apple?” In many respects, he is unknowable to me as much as I am unknowable to myself. Our identity, our sense of self is always changing, in constant flux. We cling to labels to provide us with a more stable identity but in reality, we have no unchanging self. One of my favorite quotes from Heraclitus describes this idea well:

> "Man cannot step in the same river twice for it is not the same river and he is not the same man." - Heraclitus

To describe or explain anything is an unending task. You could go into endless detail. There is a futility in writing (but its also one of my favorite activities so I am going to keep doing it). The world cannot be represented by symbols. We can't actually capture a moment in a painting or picture or audio recording. All things must pass and time pushes forward. When you watch an old home video and relive an old memory, it is no longer the same experience that you originally had living it. When you revisit a river, it has changed and so have you.
