I struggle with addiction to technology. As a graduate of Computer Science, I have been interested in technology and what its appropriate usage looks like for a long time. We have come a long way from Steve Jobs’ vision of computers being “a bicycle for the mind”. Though we certainly get so much value from computers and the online products that live on them, it seems that technology is increasingly using us more than we are using it and I’ve personally been struggling to reclaim control.

It’s no mystery why our devices are so addictive. Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and all other social platforms as well as Netflix, Disney+, or any streaming services make money off our attention. The ad revenue model (offering free services by selling ads) has as its main objective to keep us on the platform. Because it is profitable for these companies to hold our attention as long as possible, they study you and design the perfect feed to addict you. Not to mention, the problem will only worsen over time as technology advances.

Your curated feed isn’t meant to make you feel good. It can make you angry, less confident, or simply passively entertained. It also leaves you with a background sense of low-level anxiety from information overload. Maybe worse, you feel that you could be missing out on something important if you don’t check your phone constantly. None of that matters to these companies. What matters is that you keep watching. My addiction to screens has negatively affected many areas of my life. I find it harder to hold my attention, and activities that were once enjoyable like reading no longer give me the same satisfaction they did before. Like in any other addiction, fewer things can match the same pleasure you get from digital dope and your baseline happiness lowers.

Maybe you don’t think you have any problem or you don’t care enough to fix it. If so, I’m not going to try to convince you. However, you should consider how you want to spend your time. Don’t mind relaxing and watching a few episodes of your favorite show on Netflix each afternoon? No problem. But if you get the feeling that you’re wasting your time and you could be doing something better, find out what that is and resolve to break the addictive cycle.

So what does a good relationship with technology look like? This is all new to humanity as we are the first generation to experience the positive and negative consequences of super-intelligent algorithms curating our intake of information. That being said, I found that the following general guidelines are helpful to reclaim control.

1. **Find your motivation**
    
    From reading James Clear’s *Atomic Habits*, I learned that to break a bad habit, it helps to know what cue or trigger causes you to repeat the behavior. What impulse are you satisfying by checking YouTube or Instagram? All habits are caused by some cue. Find the underlying cue for using your technology of choice and then find a suitable replacement to satisfy your motivation. For you, that could be a feeling like stress, boredom, or a specific time of day or environment that triggers your habit.
    
    Me, I know that I check YouTube every time I feel stressed by work and use it to relieve stress. I’ve asked myself if there is something else I could do that would have the same soothing effect as YouTube. There are many options, but one idea I’m going to try is doodling. I might still watch YouTube when stressed, but if I gradually wean myself off to a healthier way of relieving stress, I could form a replacement habit to follow the same old cue. This example may not be helpful to you, but if you take the time to introspect on why you use certain apps, you can find a better alternative to resolve your need.
    
2. **Quit Cold Turkey**
    
    In *Digital Minimalism*, the author Cal Newport advises taking a digital detox. Don’t think you’re addicted? Prove it. Take (at least) a full week to step away from the inessential apps and get in touch with what you truly want. Then you can reintroduce technology… thoughtfully. This has the added benefit of slowing you down. When you do that, you give yourself the chance to savor other activities that don’t involve screens like spending time with friends or working on a hobby. Don’t worry, the world won’t end if you can’t access your Instagram. In fact, it’s possible no one will even know you left.
    
3. **Try again**
    
    If you’re anything like me, this isn’t something you do once. I have relapsed many times even after taking long breaks. You just have to catch yourself again and again when you notice how you are negatively impacted by technology. When that happens, repeat steps 1 and 2. That’s my plan, anyway.
    

I have tried many things to curb my bad habit. I have a chrome extension that [blocks my recommended feed on YouTube](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-the-youtube-feed/cfabedkddcldcdmheehafbdonjbeffdg?hl=en), another that [monitors and limits time spent on each site](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-activity-time-tracker/hhfnghjdeddcfegfekjeihfmbjenlomm?hl=en), and an application that blocks sites to quit [cold turkey](https://getcoldturkey.com/). All of this is simply to say that breaking the habit of mindlessly turning to technology is difficult, but habits are broken gradually with repeated effort. Don’t get discouraged when you fail as the odds are absolutely stacked against you with companies pouring their resources into research to make you more addicted. Remember why you are doing this, why you care to reclaim your attention, and how you would like to make technology a “bicycle for the mind” once again. Then start over.

If you would like to learn more about the impact social media has on yourself and society at large, I highly recommend that you watch the Netflix documentary *[The Social Dilemma](https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/the-film/)*. I also recommend Cal Newport’s book *[Digital Minimalism](https://www.calnewport.com/books/digital-minimalism/)* which gives examples and guidance for using technology responsibly. Lastly, James Clear’s book *[Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits)* is great for learning about how to form or break habits.
