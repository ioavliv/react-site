*Writing is a powerful tool for self-expression and understanding. It allows me to explore my thoughts, emotions, and experiences in a deeper way. It also helps me to process and make sense of the world around me. Writing also helps me to connect with others, whether it is through shared stories or simply expressing my own perspective. Ultimately, writing is a way for me to give voice to my innermost thoughts and feelings, and in doing so, to better understand myself and the world.*
![ChatGPT](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F151efb5c-c674-4490-930a-48ba3befc8cc_2302x586.png "ChatGPT")

I didn’t write any of that. [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/auth/login), the AI that will [automate many white-collar jobs](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/chatgpt-ai-economy-automation-jobs/672767/) in the near future, did. I did actually write a more personal post about [why I write](/posts/why-i-write), but I can’t help feeling that the generic answer this unconscious AI gave isn’t far from anything I had to say, which is a sad realization. Don’t you feel a little cheated that you gave your valuable time and attention to listen to the nonexistent opinion of AI? Though my writing isn’t original and often my words sound as recycled as those of an AI, I still find the idea of reading something that wasn’t produced by any person disturbing.

Of course, AI doesn’t truly “write” or “give voice to [its] innermost thoughts and feelings”. It only guessed how the average person might answer this question, but it was right! The purpose of real writing is to discover one’s voice. Writing is by necessity personal and [unique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAwbvGywdOc), something that AI cannot compete with.

## How to use AI
I argue that AI cannot replace a real human writer’s unique perspective of the world. So is there any use of this AI for writers if it can’t give any personal opinions? I think that it can be a powerful tool to help writers articulate their thoughts. ChatGPT is the new Wikipedia and Google search combined. You get the average consensus of what everyone thinks in average acceptable writing. These are some of the different ways I’ve found to use it:

- To expand on an idea

- To come up with topics

- To research topics

- To rewrite or edit writing

- To generate title ideas (like the title of this post which was generated by AI)

This will supercharge the writers who use it effectively to be far more prolific and produce content faster.

Let me introduce you to the new field of “prompt engineering”. This is the new term being used to get better results from AI. Similar to knowing how to search on Google more efficiently, prompt engineering can get AI to deliver you the specific results you are looking for, and you as the writer can make any further edits as needed. But the AI can still do the majority of the work for you. Let’s say it can write 80% of your essay, while the remaining 20% can be added by your edits. AI will give you more time to focus on that last and more valuable 20% where you inject your voice and personality.

The best chess player in the world today is a computer, but the best human chess player is one who studies and practices with a computer. Chess players assisted by AI are better than chess players without AI. The world of writers may be influenced in a similar way. It is a more productive mindset to see AI as a helpful tool for creatives rather than the enemy of creativity. Whoever uses AI (writers, programmers, or artists) can improve with their help.

## What could possibly go wrong?
It has been said that technology is a double-edged sword. Every technological advancement has made us more powerful and capable. Each has made our lives easier and more convenient in some way, but it has also simultaneously made us weaker and dependent on them.

There is a danger that AI might hurt writers by making them less resilient. Technology makes us forget how to do things we once thought were easy. We no longer need to memorize anything we can find on Google in seconds just as we don’t need to calculate numbers if we have a calculator that can do it for us. Spell-check has already made grammar skills irrelevant. In general, previously useful knowledge and skills become obsolete.

It’s possible that tools like Grammarly could be ruining your writing and AI can flatten your language to the most basic, mundane level with no individuality. It’s certainly something I’m going to watch out for. However, it is a tool that I will likely continue to use. As much as I am a Luddite and resist new technology, there is no sense in holding that attitude. Pandora’s box has been opened and there’s no going back.
