It may be egocentric to think that others share the same problems as me, but the modern struggle as I see it is that of too much convenience, too much leisure time, and not enough direction on how to conduct oneself with all that freedom. It’s the reason why we watch TV all day or become workaholics. But [work avoidance and workaholism both come from the same place](https://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2014/09/what-is-work-aversion-and-do-you-have-it/) psychologically: a fear of being still, a fear of looking and facing things. And then taking the next step–doing something about it.

When we are bored or afraid of our minds, we naturally become addicted to distracting ourselves from this fact. Blaise Pascal famously said (back in the 1600s!) that “All of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room alone”. Modern technology is not inherently bad, though I am often guilty of demonizing it. It simply is the place we go to when we want to distract ourselves and avoid confronting certain emotions. Even without modern technology, we can (and have historically) become addicted to distractions in whatever form they take.

Continued distraction will only help numb emotions temporarily before they return to haunt us throughout our lives. The only lasting solution is to face them directly. So how exactly can we be still and work through them? I think progress begins by identifying more specific thoughts and emotions rather than feeling a vague cloud of worry or unease. In this way, breaking down the emotion makes it easier to process. We can feel resistance to doing a task for any number of reasons, but here are a few examples:

- we aren’t confident in our ability to complete it
- we fear that it won’t live up to our perfect standards
- we are overwhelmed by its size or complexity
- we fear how others will perceive us as a result of our efforts

To be able to happily sit alone in a room with one's thoughts is a superpower that can be cultivated, though nobody said it would be easy. Being still, like most cliche advice, is tougher than it sounds. In fact, it might just be the hardest thing you can do. The psychoanalyst Carl Jung said of integrating repressed emotions that “People will do anything, no matter how absurd, to avoid facing their own souls.” To be still isn’t pretty. It means breaking a pattern of running away from yourself and instead becoming open and curious about your own mind. It means [slowing down](https://www.ioavlivneh.com/posts/slowing-down), accepting this moment, and not looking to the future for something better to come along or another distraction to carry you away from yourself.

But to end on a hopeful note, I’ve usually found that the hardest part of this process is just getting started. The emotion we want to avoid may be strong, but as soon as we confront it and try to find its source within us, it appears to dissolve and lack any force. Emotions are so abstract and intangible in our minds, yet they somehow manage to drive so many of our actions. If you get control over your emotions, you will be able to focus your mind and direct the actions that follow, finally putting an end to your cycle of distraction. Hopefully.
