René Magritte is one of my favorite artists. He not only made hypnotic surrealist art, but also used it to communicate his philosophy. Unlike other philosophers, though, he expressed his ideas through images rather than words. Of course, *The Treachery of Images* seen above is an exception. In it, Magritte directly uses language to communicate an idea with the viewer. Naturally, people will see the label "This is not a pipe" and think it is a funny mistake but of course Magritte intentionally draws your attention to this text to make you consider its meaning. 

If asked, we would normally answer that the object in the painting is a pipe, but this is a mistake in our language. We can admit that this painting of a pipe isn’t a real pipe, but we hardly feel the need to point out the difference. Likewise, even the word "pipe" is not an actual pipe that you could smoke. The word, just like the image, is merely a concept or representation and not the real thing. This painting invites us viewers to question the gap between symbols and their meanings. As the painting's name suggests, the treachery of images is in their ability to deceive and confuse us.

## Symbols and their meanings

Labeling something--or giving it a name--tricks our brains into thinking we fully know and understand what we are referring to. We transform something real and complex into a neat, abstract concept that can be manipulated in our minds. The truth is that nothing can be captured by a symbol. Magritte is reminding us that things are whatever they are, not what we say or think they are. The same concept also applies to our own self-image. I can call myself by my name, Ioav, or by descriptions such as white, male, Israeli, writer, programmer, friend, son, etc. All these labels try to capture the idea of who I am, but Magritte would argue that no amount of such labels will ever let us fully describe ourselves.

I can't make this point of confusing symbols with meanings any better than the philosopher Alan Watts did:

> "Symbols bear the same relation to the real world that money bears to wealth. You cannot quench anybody’s thirst with the word water just as you cannot eat a dollar bill and derive nutrition, but using symbols and using conscious intelligence has proved very useful to us. It has given us such technology as we have, but at the same time, it has proved too much of a good thing.
>
> At the same time, we’ve become so fascinated with it that we confuse the world as it is with the world as it is thought about, talked about and figured about, that is to say with the world as it is described. and the difference between these two is vast, and when we are not aware of ourselves except in a symbolic way, we’re not related to ourselves at all.
We’re like people eating menus instead of dinners and that’s why we all feel psychologically frustrated."

It seems clear that the painting *Son of Man* shows an apple covering a man's face. However, this reflexive view can be proven wrong upon further examination similarly to how *The Treachery of Images* needed more study to be fully understood. The artwork gives off the impression that you're not seeing the full picture. You think that if only you could move the apple aside, you would reveal a face, but that isn't necessarily true. In fact, there really is no face to be seen. The entire image is exactly as it appears. As Magritte said himself, this painting "conceals nothing". You instinctually read too much into the painting so quickly and naturally as a result of your overactive imagination. In a way, this painting is a portal to your unconscious mind that is constantly trying to make sense of the world where none exists. 

The painting also doesn't "mean" anything. By that I mean it doesn't represent any object in the real world or attempt to convey any idea. All it does is produce a feeling of confusion, and once you look at it long enough, you can learn to rest in that confusion without wishing to resolve it. I like using this painting as my online avatar because it is as mysterious to me as my own identity, and it reminds me to embody this philosophy of accepting confusion. I may never know who I am, but I am just as comfortable with that knowledge as I am with the knowledge that Magritte's painting doesn't conceal a face.

## Know thyself

I feel most comfortable representing myself online as this ambiguous and enigmatic figure because it reminds me that I am not who I believe myself to be. I am beyond words and beyond description. So are you. We are all undefinable. Alan Watts made a similar claim when he pointed out that eyes cannot see themselves, ears can't hear themselves, and noses can't smell themselves. A light also can't illuminate itself, fire can't burn itself, and a knife can't cut itself. This is what I am referring to when I say I don't know myself. My senses are unable to perceive themselves. When I look for myself as a matter of experience, it appears there is nothing to find--no unchanging center that I can finally point to and say "that is me".

I feel uneasy sharing any advice, particularly any that sound remotely "spiritual" since I am acutely aware that none of my ideas are original, but I have found this insight invaluable: **You are not your thoughts**. Who you believe yourself to be is an illusion, a trick you play on yourself. To borrow Shakespeare's words, your thoughts are but a walking shadow, they are simply a story or narrative that you continually manufacture but are free to drop anytime you like by recognizing them as being just that. It is easier said than done, but helpful nonetheless.

## The online persona

As I said before, I am constantly changing. That includes my opinions as well as my ability to write and communicate ideas (which I hope will improve). The internet is not so forgiving with change as anything that gets uploaded becomes a permanent record. This is a problem in our modern world that values online presence often more than real physical presence. People get the sense that things don’t happen unless they are documented online and opinions are not registered unless they are typed out as comments. Approval and validation only exist as quantifiable likes. I apologize if this sounds overly cynical, but it helps get my point across that people take their online personas far too seriously.

You will not find me on my website or in my writing. **This is not Ioav**. I think that if I can remember not to get attached or cling to this fictional creation of mine, I will be able to avoid taking myself or my writing so seriously. I will try to be as honest as I can in my writing without intending to sound smart or impress people, but rather stick to sharing something useful or interesting. My goal ultimately is to either educate or entertain. 

I think Magritte would agree that art should not be made for validation, but enjoyment. So I'm not going to think of my writing as serious work, but sincere play. The act of writing in private helps me think about myself less, and that is exactly when I feel most like myself. Notice that feeling begins where thinking ends. Unfortunately, putting myself online and revealing my personal thoughts makes me slightly self-conscious. So here's to Magritte, to art, to philosophy, and to the playful and unserious attitude that relieves us from overthinking and allows us to forget who we are.
