title: Making Time for Creativity, Despite Our Busy Lives
description: On the regret of a guilty conscience and the fear of perfectionistic artists.

One of the biggest problems I found myself and my friends having lately is feeling like we have an untapped potential in us that we are slowly losing by the day. It doesn’t help that we are also constantly comparing ourselves with the successes of others over the internet. This mindset leads to the feeling of wasting time or being behind in life. It's a thought pattern that can really drag you down and demotivate you to the point of paralysis. What is it that prevents us from starting something we want to do? How do we overcome it? I would argue that more often than not, our own fear of failure and perfectionist tendencies are the sources of inaction. The following is my personal experience facing these obstacles and moving past them.

We all have busy lives. We have work to do and people to take care of. It seems like there's no point in adding creative pursuits on top of the pile of to-dos. What is the point of it anyway? I believe that creativity, like sleep, is necessary for our health. It can be a retreat from everyday life to do something that fulfills us. However, we rarely get satisfaction from creative pursuits when we set expectations on how perfect they need to be.

Believe me, I have a lot of experience feeling paralyzed by my creative ambition. Ever since I was a kid, I said I wanted to be an author and illustrator. My mom recently found this poem where I clearly knew that for myself and somehow forgot as I got older.

Of course, hardly anyone can make money as a full-time creative so I was practical and took up programming as a career path. My friends who aspire to be musicians and comedians followed a similar path, the practical one. Of course, I'm not arguing that we all quit our jobs and "follow our passions". We have to be reasonable and think about how we can afford our lifestyles. However, we also cannot afford to give up on the things we care about the most. This is why I argue that we must make time for our creative pursuits, despite our busy lives.

I’m the only person responsible for my life and how I spend my time. When I first started my job after college, I convinced myself that I was being held down to work and this career path I had chosen was fixed for the rest of my life--but that simply isn’t true. Only I am responsible for the way I spend my time. Of course, I haven’t simply quit my job, but I reprioritized its importance in my life appropriately. I no longer see my job as the most important part of my day that requires all my effort. Instead, I do enough to keep my financial situation secure without compromising on my creative endeavors and physical health. You have to ask yourself what truly matters to you in life. I realized that for me, doing creative work is as much of a necessity in my life as food, safety, and community. Abraham Maslow had that figured out before me.

It is for this reason that after years of tiptoeing around the idea of publishing my writing online, I’ve decided to finally take the leap. Believing that writing is something I need to do defeats any reluctance I had before. My fear of failure and perfectionism held me back as they do for many people, but they no longer hold power over me. Any fears I had about people not liking my writing or not even reading it no longer matter to me. Fears about having to make something perfect or having something important to write about don’t matter either. I accept that right now, I’m not a great writer, but I’m working towards becoming a better one. What matters is the satisfaction I get by writing right now. I may be far from being an author that I always wanted to be, but I’m taking steps towards becoming that person.

Making this website and filling it with my writing is fun, and I wouldn't do it if it wasn't. I have a 9-5 job and feel tired by the end of most days, but no matter how tired I feel and how few people read my work, I will always want to work on this site and improve my writing. So please excuse me while I introspect publicly. Sharing my vulnerabilities to the whole of the internet, opening myself up to judgement and criticism is not ideal, but it is something I have to do to please the kid in me that always wanted to write.

## Your Turn

If you have these same creative needs (and I have a feeling that you do) and the same fears holding you back, I urge you to also take the leap. Use your creativity. Your mind will thank you. As cliché as it sounds, the only way to reach your goals is by moving in their direction. A large ambition could paralyze you at the thought of all the work it takes to achieve, but you don’t have to think about the end-goal to take steps now and enjoy them now. To my creative friends with dreams of becoming musicians and comedians, just start working on your craft and enjoy the attempt without any expectations of success. You have no control over the way others will receive your work. The only thing within your control is continuing to create. This is ultimately where you should get your satisfaction from. Make room in your life for nurturing your creativity.

This is a reminder for myself just as much as anyone reading to keep pursuing the things which you truly desire and not allow yourself to make any exceptions. If you really care about making something, find time to do it before or after your job or on the weekends. Don’t give up on the things that matter to you even if you look like an idiot doing so. This is the only way to avoid a bitter life of regret and resentment. I don’t have it figured out. I don’t know what to write about. I don’t have a niche. I don’t know how I can earn money through writing but I will not give up writing about whatever interests me right now because it’s fun and I don’t need anyone’s permission to do so.
