title: Why I Write
description: 7 reasons why I write

Lately, I’ve been reflecting on what has compelled me to start writing and sharing my newsletter in the first place. This is definitely a longer, rambling, and more self-indulgent post than previous ones, but I’m not forcing you to read on. There, you have been warned. With that disclaimer out of the way, I’ll start asking my rhetorical questions: Why do I do post my writing online? and why do I not feel the sting of embarrassment that I would have felt before? Here are 7 reasons I’ve come up with for why I write:

## 1. It’s a genetic thing

I remember writing short stories at around seven years old using Microsoft Word and built-in clip art for illustrations. I feel that I must have some genetic drive to want to put words on paper—or type them on a screen. And I still don’t quite understand what that drive is. Because it’s not like I have anything important to say (certainly not when I was seven), and I’m not qualified to talk about anything other than myself. I mentioned [in an earlier newsletter](https://ioav.substack.com/p/ioavs-month-oct-2022) that the writing I’ve shared so far has been in the type of self-help genre because those are the kind of books I’ve read lately. In fact, I only got back into reading books late in college for self-help stuff. Before that, I really only read for class assignments and the occasional *Diary of a Wimpy Kid* or Greek/Roman/Egyptian mythology series by Rick Riordan (you may know *Percy Jackson*, *The* *Lightning Thief*). And yet I did claim to want to be a writer as a child. I struggle to remember why. Was there something I wanted to say and couldn’t express or communicate? Did I just love creating fictional characters and worlds? Was I just a fan of sentence structures and spelling and grammar? Maybe it was some combination of all these things.

Recently, I’ve been thinking that besides all these points, my “passion” has not been so much in writing or telling stories as it is exploring ideas. When reading science fiction novels, I’ve always cared more about the imaginative technologies and their implications on a future society than about the characters or specific plot they found themselves in. In high school, I loved history class and learning about how different societies choose to organize, and the different religions they adhered to as well as anything related to the field of psychology and philosophy that I could get my hands on. I was self-motivated to go down deep YouTube rabbit holes where contemporary philosophers and scientists debated ideas. Actually, this led to my reintroduction to books in university. Browsing YouTube, I found Jordan Peterson, a college professor giving engaging university lectures on psychology and religion. That led me to buy and read his books and dig deeper into other authors and deep thinkers he recommended that I’d never heard of before like Carl Jung and Dostoevsky.

## 2. For posterity/immortality

Is there a part of me that wants to be like these famous people? Definitely. I would love to be remembered for coming up with groundbreaking, interesting, useful, consequential ideas like many psychologists and philosophers of the past. Who wouldn’t? It would be amazing if my name were in textbooks as required reading. I doubt I’m the only person who has ever had that grandiose, narcissistic, entitled thought before. In fact, Ernest Becker wrote about that desire in detail in his book *The Denial of Death* (which I have yet to read). But I know that right now I have no new interesting ideas to share and honestly, why would I? There are plenty of philosophers and psychologists and interesting people who have said so many insightful things in the past that I have yet to hear about and read. I need to do my job first of reading and understanding these books before I could ever think to share an original thought—if I’m capable of those at all.

## 3. For clarity/organization

Without writing, thoughts are disconnected and unorganized. I write to make sense of what I’ve learned, what I believe, and what I can take action on. I make countless to-do lists because I *need* to get thoughts out of my mind. Otherwise, I feel overwhelmed and lose good ideas to my terrible memory. Any time I have a curious thought, I feel the need to grab a paper and pencil to capture the ideas that interest me before they disappear. This blogpost you’re reading that lists reasons why I write is an example of me organizing my thoughts. I didn’t start with a numbered list, but spontaneously organized my writing and thinking into these categories in the process. 

## 4. To discover what I think

One misconception a lot of people have about writing is that you need to have fully-formed ideas to start. That hasn’t been my experience. You can sit down and start writing with a blank mind and discover what you think along the way. Sometimes, you might surprise yourself with what comes out.

The best writing is confronting taboos. Good writers are honest, and that leaves them incredibly naked and vulnerable and open to judgment. In high school, my essays always scored low in the “voice” grading criteria. I never understood what that meant and always argued for a higher grade saying, “Of course it’s my voice! I wrote it!” But I suppose I was afraid to say what I really felt and instead hid behind other people’s quotes or repeated clichés. To find my own voice, I had to be willing to be heard and judged.

## 5. To evolve

As human beings, we are constantly changing. It’s sad for parents to see their children grow up and be so different from the toddlers they remember, but that process never ends. Old friends of yours are not the same as they once were. Old partners (if you’ve been together for a long time) have also changed. We are normally uncomfortable with this idea that people are not stable and can’t be expected to remain so, but there’s no sense in arguing with the laws of nature. That simply is the fact of things. As such, writing is a way to remember and honor those parts of myself that the new version of me continually renounces or moves beyond in some way. There is a real sense in which I become a different person by the end of every fully written piece.

I was embarrassed at first to share my writing for anyone to read and judge because so much of my identity is tied to my ideas. But as I continued to share more, I became more confident with my opinions. I didn’t need to feel any support from anyone (though it helped when someone said they liked it). Each time I hit the publish button, I felt more connected to my words and felt that I could stand behind them and defend them. Though I still feel occasionally embarrassed, I stand behind my words.

## 6. To connect with other like-minded people

Sharing ideas with others is a way to feel less alone and more connected. There are different mediums to do this. I'm drawn to writing, but many others feel motivated to share through music, painting, or performing arts. That's why I originally started writing online. I want to have more interesting conversations with my friends and family. I want to know if my friends relate to my ideas on [digital dope](https://www.ioavlivneh.com/posts/digital-dope) or if my family agrees that [self-help is selfless](https://www.ioavlivneh.com/posts/self-help-is-selfless).

It’s hard for me to write with an audience in mind, especially since most of my past audiences have been English teachers. A lot of the time, I imagine I’m writing for my younger self. I imagine what problems I had and what information I could give myself that would have helped me. Being older and wiser, I try to gather together whatever I’ve learned through reading or experience and try to sum it up into small, neat packages. I didn’t like to read much when I was younger anyway so its important to be concise (unlike this post). 

## 7. To help someone

Words carry an enormous amount of power and potential to help people. That would explain the insatiable market for self-help books. I know that I have personally benefitted from some of those  self-help books as much as others. There is a fitting ancient latin saying: *Liber medicina animi* (A book is medicine for the soul).

Even though I did eventually learn everything I now know through books and the internet, I don’t see the harm in being yet another voice spreading good ideas. I know that the world is already saturated with a lot of people saying the same things as me, and a lot of it is common wisdom like [make time for creativity](https://www.ioavlivneh.com/posts/making-time-for-creativity) and [be grateful,](https://www.ioavlivneh.com/posts/are-you-grateful) but it’s what I needed to hear and what I keep needing to remind myself constantly. Even though it’s all been said before, I like to believe that I am extending the reach of these positive ideas further by repeating them. I want to continue to spread helpful ideas even if they are not original. If I help one person with my writing, it’s all been worthwhile.

If this writing somehow managed to help someone in some way, I’m glad. If not, I still appreciate your attention for making it this far. Either way, I will continue writing new things whether anyone is reading or not.
