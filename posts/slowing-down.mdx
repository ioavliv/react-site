How often have you thought “I’ll be happy when ____”? We live as though we will one day reach a place where all our problems will be solved, and there will be nothing left on our to-do list. Until we reach that point, we constantly feel behind like we’re paying off some debt to break even. In doing so, we hold our happiness hostage for a future that never arrives when all of our desires or goals have been met.

Because of that false belief, we hurry through our life. After all, the sooner we get everything done, the sooner we can sit back and relax. So we try to get everything done faster and more efficiently. That explains our love of productivity hacks, shortcuts, direct flights, same-day delivery, or any other kind of time-savers. We are impatient. We want everything *now*, and yet we postpone our happiness for an abstract future when we’ll have sufficient reasons for enjoying the present. The truth is, we don’t need any of those reasons.

That is why there is an unconventional value in slowing down. When we stop rushing, we lose the anxiety of trying to manage our time so efficiently. Instead, we become more patient and appreciate things as they are now, however imperfect. The future appropriately becomes less valuable than the present, even if nothing much is going on.

The normal attitude for almost everyone is feeling guilty about wasting time. We’re overly concerned about how we are spending it, but sometimes the best use of our time is to waste it freely and cease to care about using it well. Make the shift towards valuing this moment more than the next and appreciating what you already have. I promise you’ll feel better. The future will still arrive all the same.
