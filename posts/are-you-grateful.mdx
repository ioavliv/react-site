There’s an old saying that “comparison is the thief of joy”. Indeed, we often imagine all the ways our lives could be better and feel resentful when they aren’t so. However, we could just as easily think of how much worse our lives could be—and they could always be worse. Doing this kind of negative visualization can help us appreciate what we’ve got right now. It turns out that comparison (when done skillfully) can actually bring us joy.

The scientific term for “taking things for granted” is called [hedonic adaptation](https://www.verywellmind.com/hedonic-adaptation-4156926). To sum it up: Just as how you stop sensing the clothes you’re wearing after they’ve rested on your skin for a while, you stop noticing the good things in your life when you’ve had them for long enough periods. The only way to avoid gradually tuning out the good things in life is to practice remaining sensitive to them.

The Buddha called gratitude one of the most beautiful and rare qualities in the world. It is rare precisely because it is unnatural and needs to be practiced. It is also frequently [prescribed by mental health professionals](https://www.forbes.com/health/mind/mental-health-benefits-of-gratitude/) because it helps people break out of negative thought loops, whether they are depressive or anxious. It is through changing your perspective and focusing on the positives that you learn how to think like an optimist rather than a pessimist.

We don’t appreciate the beauty in everyday life because we are constantly surrounded by it. The most common things people say they’re grateful for around the holidays are friends and family, health, and a roof over their heads. But occasionally, I think of how grateful I am for even more basic things such as the ability to see colors, hear sounds, or move my body. Believe me, I know how sappy that sounds.

People understandably don’t like to practice gratitude (myself included) because it feels forced, and there is a part of us that often likes to stay upset rather than look for silver linings. It reminds me of this funny scene from Big Mouth where the literal personification of gratitude, the Gratitoad, annoys the main character.

At the risk of sounding as annoying as the Gratitoad, I’d like to say how grateful I am for my friends and family. I may take them for granted at times, but in this moment of writing, I’m reminded of how much I love them and am grateful to be a part of their lives.
