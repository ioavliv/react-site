In 2005, David Foster Wallace gave a commencement [speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsAd4HGJS4o) at Kenyon College that is now one of his most-read pieces. In it, he encouraged his audience to escape their “hard-wired default setting which is to be deeply and literally self-centered”. He began with this parable:

> There are these two young fish swimming along, and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says, “Morning, boys. How’s the water?” And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes, “What the hell is water?”

He went on to explain the purpose of employing this parable.

> The point of the fish story is merely that the most obvious, important realities are often the ones that are hardest to see and talk about....The fact is that in the day to day trenches of adult existence, banal platitudes can have a life or death importance.

I think my interest in philosophy and history from the very start has been the desire to know what has always been true in the past and will continue to be true in the future. In other words, I’ve searched for the universal truths of the world if such things exist. Of course, the answer to an idea so broad and vague as that is going to sound like so many of the platitudes I’d heard before. Nevertheless, properly giving each of them their deserved time, I came to understand why clichés are of “life and death importance” as Wallace suggested.

Banal platitudes or clichés are “lame and unexciting” and understandably devoid of all meaning since you’ve heard them a million times before in a million different ways. This does not, however, make them false or unimportant. We constantly forget the most basic truths in life—not because the answers are hard to come across, but because they are too obvious and universal to be recognized.

This idea is echoed in the utopian dream of Aldous Huxley’s Island where talking birds repeated the phrases “Here and now, boys” and “Attention” to constantly remind the citizens to be present in their lives. The people of this utopia, however enlightened they were, still needed to be constantly reminded that the present moment is all anyone has, and it is their moral duty to recognize it and seize it.

Just as Wallace said in his speech, I also hesitate to present myself here as the wise, older fish explaining what water is to you younger fish (You’re likely wiser and older than me if you’re reading this). I am not the wise old fish, but I still want to articulate what I believe Wallace meant by water. I believe these are some of the banal platitudes of timeless wisdom that Wallace was referring to:

- Everything changes a.k.a. All things must pass

    - therefore there is nothing to become attached to

- Everyone is mortal a.k.a. Our time is limited and nonrefundable

    - therefore each moment is worth appreciating

- All actions have consequences a.k.a. The law of causality

    - therefore what I do right now matters

We need to remember ancient wisdom that helps us navigate these truths: focus only on what you control, be good and virtuous, disciplined and courageous. Forgive others, let things go, etc. These are not commandments, only tools for living a better life. David Foster Wallace would have agreed with Huxley that religious dogmatism like following commandments is not the answer to a better world. In his commencement speech, he said that he was not attempting to preach morality or concerned about discussing life after death.

> The capital-T Truth is about life BEFORE death. It is about the real value of a real education, which has almost nothing to do with knowledge, and everything to do with simple awareness; awareness of what is so real and essential, so hidden in plain sight all around us, all the time, that we have to keep reminding ourselves over and over:
> 
> This is water.
> 
> This is water.

Our natural programming or “default setting” is easy and automatic self-centeredness and forgetting the truth of the water that surrounds us. Wallace wished for us to manage rather than remove our core hard-wired human instincts. Huxley said something similar:

> We cannot reason ourselves out of our basic irrationality. All we can do is to learn the art of being irrational in a reasonable way.
> 
> — Aldous Huxley, Island

You already knew what water was before I told you. Wallace’s call to action was to set reminders to keep that knowledge at the front of your mind at all times. This is your reminder. Become aware of your “default setting”.

What do we want?

Attention!

When do we want it?

Here and now!
