          <p>As I learned from my high school [English literature teacher](/posts/teacher), the word "essay" comes from the French meaning ‚Äúto attempt‚Äù. I decided to write a series of essays to live on my website to serve as my personal statements and opinions on topics that are dear to me. They interest me/call to me. I am drawn to them. All my thoughts on a subject. I just want to write about the things I care about and attribute where I got inspiration from and who I learned from and what books I read. If you already know about these, you are unlikely to learn anything new from me. I just want to share my influences and what shapes my worldview.
          </p>
          <p>
            These essays are *attempts* to straighten out my thoughts on particular subjects that interest me and on another level, these essays are *attempts* to improve my writing ability and quality to produce something worth reading.
            I want to concretize my ideas on a number of subjects and I want to be able to communicate those ideas effectively.
          </p>
          <p>Why did I spend all this time writing all my thoughts on a subject and uploading them publicly online? 1) because writing is how I discover what my thoughts are about a topic 2) maybe youre curious to know my thoughts and we can chat about it and be friends üòä (lead to good conversations)</p>

          <p>I'm not on any social platforms, if you want to stay up-to-date on what I'm doing, join my mom and grandma on this monthly mailing list where I share one photo, quote, and a summary of my week.</p>
